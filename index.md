The second pre-chi event at Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI) will take place on April 3rd, 2020 at CWI in Amsterdam. Join us for a day of CHI paper talks, LBW presentations, and networking with fellow HCI researchers in the Netherlands.

We will provide coffee and lunch during the day, and later we can enjoy dinner and drinks in Amsterdam (location TBA). If you would like to present CHI 2020 work (paper, case study, LBW, etc.), please get in touch -- we still have some slots available. A preliminary program can be found [here](program).
