## What is this Dutch Post-CHI event?

Following the global spirit of meeting fellow HCI folks within a local region, this year CHI NL aims at bringing the HCI community in the Netherlands together after CHI 2021. The goal is to provide an opportunity for researchers to present and discuss their accepted CHI 2021 works in a smaller and cozier manner than what the enormity and madness of the (virtual) CHI ship allows. We are currently still developing the program, but this will include:

1. CHI 2021 paper pitches & breakout discussions
2. Panel discussions (on CHI Netherlands, trends within CHI, industry panel)
3. Informal social chat and networking

Join us for two European mornings of exciting CHI 2021 talks, networking, and collective reflection with fellow HCI researchers in the Netherlands. Everyone from students to professors to industry practitioners to artists is welcome.


## How to participate

Anyone is free to attend, without being required to submit or present anything. If you wish to present, your presentation(s) can be informal, and we won't ask you to invest any extra effort on top of what you have already done for the CHI conference. Feel free to re-use existing slides or a poster, or just free-form talk about your work and answer questions.


If you would like to participate as a presenter (CHI work: paper, LBW, demo, case study...) or attendee, please fill the form to register by clicking the link below.
